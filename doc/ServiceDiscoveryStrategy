Advanced function(Do it later):
1. Broker detect its broker siblings, if the number of them is increased, then try to kill the connection from a handler
 if its connection number is more than 2. the difference of number of handlers that each broker connected is less than 1;

2. Handler detect connections, if connection is disconnected(for example, the broker connected before is crashed)ï¼Œ
 then try to find a broker which has the lowest connections and connect. If no broker found, retry later.
 
3. The change of connection number should be synchronized, the better method is using lock, however at random point in time
 to detect connection may be ok.
